# AND Digital Coding Challenges

## All Challenges are saved as individual branches. Please see branch for challenge code.

## Challenge 1 - "Control C, Control V" :clipboard:
Welcome back! Here's a fun little string manipulation challenge to kick things off. The challenge is to analyse these strings for any instances of [CTRL+C] and [CTRL+V]. When [CTRL+C] is encountered, the contents of the string before it should be 'copied' to a clipboard. Upon any instance of [CTRL+V] in the string, this clipboard should be pasted in its place. If [CTRL+V] is encountered before any corresponding [CTRL+C] then it should simply paste nothing.
### Rewards:
- :five:  Points are awarded for a working algorithm as described above
- :three:  Further points are awarded for supporting [CTRL+X], which should remove the preceding text before copying it to the clipboard
- :two:  Further points are awarded for validating your solution with a collection of unit tests
### Example:
For this example input:
challenge("the first[CTRL+C] Coding Challenge was [CTRL+V] string manipulation task")
Your solution might output:
"the first Coding Challenge was the first string manipulation task"
### Submission:
When you have a solution, submit a link to your source code repo using the /submit command here on Slack. Please include any code and data required in order to test your solution easily. Submission closes 1st February, 17:00
Good luck good luck good luck good luck (edited)
